# webpack-optimization-starter
This repo is the result of a Webpack 5 course I'm taking.

Please feel free to use this if you're taking the same course as me. I found some of the lessons particularly tedious, especially when swapping out entire CSS preprocessors, that was pretty wild. Just search for the lesson you're on and checkout that commit. Hopefully this helps!
